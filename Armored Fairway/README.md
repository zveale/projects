My brother and I worked on this for our game programming class. It took 10 weeks 
to complete. It was our first time using unity but there is a ton of documentation 
online to get us up to speed. This game was inspired by kirbyâ€™s dream course for 
super nintendo.

I worked on the levels and UI excluding the main UI overlay for each level. I 
worked on intro scene, pause scene, ending scene including all the logic to switch
between each scene. I created the levels in blender and added lights and reflection 
probes to the scene along with logic for game objects. Besides the level creation I 
made the laser which was probably the most entertaining thing to make. This
project was a lot of fun and my brother and I hope to work on another project 
again in the future.
